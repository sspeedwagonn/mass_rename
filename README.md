# Mass File Renamer

When organizing my files, I noticed many had the same names. Due to this, I could either give up on organizing them or rename each individually, but that would take longer than I'd care for. Because of this issue, I created this python script which opens a GUI that handles the process. (:

To use it: 
1. Run `py mass_rename.py`
2. Select the folder containing your files
3. Set the prefix to add to the file names
4. Click "Rename Files"

**Future Plans**
- Add options for suffixes or replacing parts of filenames
- Add preview functionality before renaming
- Choose files that should have the prefix
